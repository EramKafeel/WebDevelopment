            <h1>Regulatory assessment & monitoring</h1>
            
            <p>Regulatory assessment plays a key role in registration and life cycle maintenance of Pharmaceutical
	 and Biological products. It is important at various stages of product development such as: prior to Regulatory submission,
	 during review and approval and post-approval of the product for global markets.
	MarketsVerge helps clients to understand the open points to be addressed and prepare the mitigation plan before Regulatory submission
	 for any Pharmaceutical/Biological product. Our Regulatory assessment minimizes the possible rejections from Health Authorities, 
	delays in review cycles with deficiencies and also accelerates the approval processes.
